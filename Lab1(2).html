    <h1>Welcome to FK</h1>

    <hr>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Faculty of Computing (formerly known as Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering) was established on
        16 February 2002 to produce knowledgeable, high skilled and competitive graduates within the sphere of software
        engineering, system and computer network. At the beginning, the faculty had two fields which are Software
        Engineering and Networking.
        The faculty has also embarked on research and development activities in the area such as information systems,
        software engineering, computer systems, communication systems, graphic and multimedia technology to produce
        technologies that are relevant to the needs of industries. Currently, the faculty has four research groups which
        are Network & Security, Modeling & Simulation, Data Mining & Knowledge Management and Graphic & Image Processing
        to support university's focus groups (Manufacturing & Automotive and Chemical & Biotechnology).
        The faculty emphasizes on the development and growth of its students' enrolment and graduates. Through high
        quality teaching (by completing specific quality outcome and generic skills), great laboratories facilities,
        proper and careful advising and numerous professional activities, our students have opportunity to excel in the
        classroom and laboratory session. In a personable atmosphere, the students become well prepared in the term of
        software engineering knowledge and technical skills. Thus, they are ready and confident to begin their
        professional career or further their studies.
        The faculty's current planning is to be an ICT reference centre in Pahang to support the development of East
        Coast Economic Region (ECER), Malaysia. To realize this, many activities which involve industries and government
        sectors have been carried out.
