    <h1><u>Understanding Copyright</u></h1>
    <p>
        <b>Copyright</b> is a legal concept that grants creators of original works exclusive rights to their use and
        distribution. These rights are intended to protect the creator's investment of time, effort, and creativity.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Copyright</h2>
    <p><b>Copyright</b> applies to a wide range of works, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Literary works</li>
        <li>Musical compositions</li>
        <li>Artistic works</li>
        <li>Films and videos</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It gives the creator the right to control how their work is used, allowing them to benefit financially from
        their creations. This includes rights such as <b>reproduction</b>, <b>distribution</b>, and <b>performance</b>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Duration of Copyright</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Copyright</b> typically lasts for the lifetime of the creator plus an additional number of years after their
        death, which varies by country. For example, in the United States, it is generally the creator's life plus 70
        years.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Exceptions and Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        There are exceptions to <b>copyright</b>, such as <i>fair use</i>, which allows for limited use of copyrighted
        material without permission for purposes like criticism, comment, news reporting, education, and research.
