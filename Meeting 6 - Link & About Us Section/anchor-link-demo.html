    <h1 id="definition">Definition of Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with sensors,
        software, and other technologies. These objects are connected to the Internet, enabling them to collect and
        exchange data. IoT aims to extend Internet connectivity beyond traditional devices like desktops and laptops to
        everyday objects, enhancing their functionality and providing advanced analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
        IoT enables real-time data collection and sharing, which can lead to improved efficiency and innovation in
        various sectors. This technology allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely, creating opportunities for
        direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        By leveraging IoT, businesses and individuals can automate processes, monitor systems in real-time, and gain
        insights through data analytics, ultimately enhancing productivity and decision-making.
    </p>

    <h1 id="example">Example of Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>
    <p>
        One example of the Internet of Things is the <b>smart thermostat</b>. A smart thermostat, such as the Nest
        Thermostat, connects to the Internet and allows users to control their home heating and cooling systems remotely
        via a smartphone app. It uses sensors to detect when people are home and learns their preferences over time,
        optimizing the temperature settings to save energy and improve comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smart thermostats can also integrate with other smart home devices, such as lights and security systems,
        creating
        a more connected and automated home environment. They provide real-time data on energy usage, helping users to
        monitor and reduce their energy consumption effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        By utilizing IoT technology, smart thermostats offer convenience, energy savings, and greater control over home
        environments, showcasing the practical benefits of connected devices in everyday life.
